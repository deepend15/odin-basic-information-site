After initiation of `index.js` in the command line via Node.js, serves 4 different pages of an extremely basic informational site via:

* [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
* [localhost:8080/about](http://localhost:8080/about)
* [localhost:8080/contact-me](http://localhost:8080/contact-me)
* any other pathname following 'localhost:8080' (i.e. [localhost:8080/info](http://localhost:8080/info) - leads to 404 error page)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of creating a server via vanilla Node.js.
